    <!--
      Create a script tag here, and with JavaScript and React, add two "p"s to the
      div element created above.
      The first span should have the text "Hello, TI2",
      and the second should have the text "Hello, React".

      Notes:
      - ReactDOM.render() replaces the contents of the DOM node that it uses. You'll need to find a way around that.
      - ReactDOM.render() doesn't accept Components (like Hello), only Elements.
          Remember: how do you create a React Element from a component?
      - React Component functions MUST start with an UPPERCASE letter, like a class.
      - The React.createElement() function supports multiple contents, by adding more arguments at the end.
          Perhaps you can make an element that wraps others?

    <script>
      /**
       * A React Component that says hello to someone.
       * props:
       *   - name: The name to which to say hello.
       * returns:
       *   - <p> element with a message that says "Hello".
       */
      function Hello(props) {
        // Create a React Element for a <p> that has the message.
        let message = React.createElement("p", {}, "Hello, " + props.name);

        // React Components return React Elements.
        return message;
      }

      // Grab a reference to the <div> on which we'll put our app.
      let app = document.querySelector("#app");

      // React Components are used with React.createElement.
      // If we want to get a "Hello" React Element, we use it like this:
      let helloReact = React.createElement(Hello, { name: "React" });

      // We can create as many Component Instances (i.e., Elements) as we want. It's like new() in Java,
      // where the class is the Component, and new() gives the Element (object) from the class.
      let helloTI2 = React.createElement(Hello, { name: "TI2" });

      // If you notice here, we pass 4 arguments to React.createElement.
      // This function allows as many arguments as you need, as long as the 3rd argument onwards
      // are React Elements. These elements are made "children" of the <div> element we create.
      // This gives us:
      // <div>
      //   <Hello name="React" />
      //   <Hello name="TI2" />
      // </div>
      let helloEveryone = React.createElement("div", {}, helloReact, helloTI2);

      // Put the <p> element that's saved in the "helloEveryone" variable inside the <div> that
      // we created above.
      // ReactDOM.render only receives two arguments: The React Element we want to render,
      // and the DOM node (a <div>, a <p>, a <span>, etc.) where we want to put it on.
      // This gives us the following HTML (inside the <div> that already exists):
      // <div> <!-- This is from "helloEveryone" -->
      //   <p>Hello, React</p> <!-- This is from <Hello name="React" /> -->
      //   <p>Hello, TI2</p> <!-- This is from <Hello name="TI2" /> -->
      // </div>
      ReactDOM.render(helloEveryone, app);
